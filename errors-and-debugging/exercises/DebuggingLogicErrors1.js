/* Imagine we are running a space station. Your job is to evaluate the stationâ€™s code and fix any errors. The lives of the crew rest squarely upon your shoulders.

Your directions from superiors:

Launch the shuttle only if the fuel, crew and computer all check out OK.
If a check fails, print that information to the console and scrub the launch.
If all checks are successful, print a countdown to launch in the console.*/
